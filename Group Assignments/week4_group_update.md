# Examining Livable Transit Oriented Development

## Roles
Brittany: Data Researcher, Trial Maps,  Disseminate research readings on TODs. Brittany will be focusing on the livability part of our data, such as the livability index and each transit oriented districts’ score of livability. 

Pearl : Data Researcher, Trial Maps, Disseminate research readings on TODs. Pearl will be focusing on the data on transit options and barriers, specifically looking at bike lanes, and bus stops.
We both divided up the work, and each individually found different data to focus and translated it into maps. We also have a shared folder to share data and important readings related to the topic. Other than that, we also try to check in weekly with each other. 

## Status Update 
I believe at first we both felt overwhelmed in the direction we were going and wanted to make sure that our goals were tangible. In order to help us ground our work, we created a backwards plan. The backwards plans help us keep track of our work and that we are on schedule for the final project. We then know who is assigned to do what research and who will begin making certain maps. We meet over zoom or phone so we can review where we are and if we have to edit the backwards plan in accordance with the new material we are learning. 
For the project proposal, the flow we are thinking of is a general comparison of the 11 Transit Oriented Districts in LA county. At first we will begin by comparing each station with each of their transportation scores through the AARP livability index. Then we will be focusing on two or three transit stations that are in LA City, and use isochrome and other functions to generate the comparison outcomes we wanted. 

## Data Update
At this moment we are thinking about incorporating the data we could find on the Southern California Association of Governments. such as: [disadvantaged communities in City of Long Beach and Los Angeles] (https://gisdata-scag.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/sb-535-disadvantaged-areas/explore?location=35.767442%2C-95.221420%2C4.32) The disadvantaged communities are measured through pollution, which inspired us to combine different environmental percentiles as our measurements, such as [CalEnviroScreen] (https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen/report/calenviroscreen-40) 

## Concerns 
Translating Data where the data isn’t available as CSV or shp.files. Our main concern at the moment is ensuring that we are not proposing lofty goals for ourselves. Since we are interested in using AARP’s Livability index we are unsure how to translate the data. We will set up a time to discuss in office hours.
