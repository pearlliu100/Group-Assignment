# Group-Assignment: Examining Livable Transit Oriented Development

## Introduction: 
Within our research, we are going to explore transit-oriented development (TOD) by examining [transit-oriented districts](https://planning.lacounty.gov/tod) in the city of Los Angeles. Since transit-oriented districts encourage “to infill development, pedestrian-friendly and community-serving uses near transit stop” we believe marrying AARP’s concepts and measurements from their [livability index](https://livabilityindex.aarp.org/categories/transportation) expands the goals of TOD for communities in the City of Los Angeles to be healthy, livable, and accessible for all ages. Therefore our research question is: How will the City of LA’s current plans for transit-oriented districts measure up to the goals of transit-oriented development and AARP’s livability index? 

## Stakes
In order to increase ridership in public transport, transit-oriented development (TOD) is a method to achieve that goal. From analyzing and measuring the current TODs, we can have a better understanding of what is crucial for efficient and sustainable planning. According to Transfers Magazine, there are two goals of TOD: an environmental goal of reducing greenhouse emissions and the social policy goal of increasing access to opportunities for residents. From their study, the two major findings are: 1. Richer TOD residents contribute more to driving reduction. 2. [Poorer residents take more transit](https://transfersmagazine.org/magazine-article/issue-7/rich-versus-poor-near-versus-far-from-transit-who-travels-more/) Through the tool of GIS, we could see how the two goals are met and see if we prioritize low-income neighborhoods that could bring out the most benefits? 


## Spatial Scope
Our spatial scope focuses on the City of Los Angeles especially the areas of Aviation/LAX, Hawthorne/Lennox, Vermont/Athens, Willowbrook, Slauson, Florence, Firestone, Del Amo, Sierre Madre Villa, 3rd Street Corridor, and 110 Freeway/Carson. These areas were chosen because they are directed as transit-oriented districts. Our temporal scope does not need any comparison of years prior, but the current state of these areas allows the proposal of future transit-oriented districts that will benefit in lowering GHG emissions and VMT in the area. 


## Data Sources
We will use data from [Metro Line Data](https://developer.metro.net/gis-data/). Metro Line’s data maps out the current metro lines in the City of Los Angeles. Another source of data is [SCAG’s LA County bike routes](https://gisdata-scag.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/SCAG::bike-routes-scag-region/explore) which was published in 2016. SCAG data maps out the available bike routes in the County of Los Angeles. 

We will also capture data from the City of Los Angeles Department of Regional Planning efforts on the [transit-oriented districts](https://planning.lacounty.gov/tod) that is directed as pedestrian-friendly and community serving near transit stops. We will also use AARP [Livability Communities scores](https://livabilityindex.aarp.org/categories/transportation)
that measures the transportation options in the area and how they are convenient, healthy, accessible, and low-cost alternatives to driving. We will also use [CalEnviroScreen](https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen/maps-data) to understand the measurements and ratings of pollution burden within the transit-oriented districts.


## Analysis & Visualization
The intended base layer of analysis will be the data from Metro Line 
Data and SCAG’s resources on LA County bike routes. We will focus on the transit-oriented district stations: Aviation/LAX, Hawthorne/Lennox, Vermont/Athens, Willowbrook, Slauson, Florence, Firestone, Del Amo, Sierre Madre Villa, 3rd Street Corridor, and 110 Freeway/Carson.

From there we will extract the AARP Livability Communities scores for the mapped out transit-oriented districts and see how the areas rate in (1) convenient transportation options, (2) accessible system design, (3) transportation costs,  and (4) safe streets. Since the research on transit-oriented development heralds the importance of sustainable transportation planning to decrease GHG emissions and lower VMTs, we will use CalEnviroScreen to layer the pollution burden percentile in the transit-oriented districts. By using these analyses and base layers we can propose potential transit-oriented districts.


## Conclusion
From our research, we hope to gain insights into the role of GIS as an analytical foundation to guide the implementation of transit-oriented districts in the city of Los Angeles. By exploring the existing TOD and AARP livability index parameters, we create our own measures in search of a more sustainable and inclusive TOD planning policy. Through identifying suitable locations for transit-oriented developments, we could get a sense of the future of these districts and therefore have a thorough understanding of other planning policies that would be needed; for example, the transit-oriented communities program is an incentive program to build more housing around the transit-oriented communities.
